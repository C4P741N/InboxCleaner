# InboxCleaner
This application is designed exclusively for Gmail users.

Introducing this console-based tool, which has been crafted to streamline the process of decluttering your email inbox. It empowers you to specify the sender's title or name, offering a remedy to the chaos of managing messages individually. This project aims to simplify the process by enabling users to input the sender's title, allowing the application to perform bulk deletion of all messages from that sender within your inbox.
